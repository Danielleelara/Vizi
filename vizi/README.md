# Desafio Frontend

Este projeto foi criado com o intuito de facilitar a gestão de uma lista de produtos, pagamentos e visualização dos seus detalhes. O projeto foi desenvolvido em ReactJs a partir da criação de uma SPA, usando react-routes para a implementação das rotas, o Axios para a busca dos dados na API e o Framework CSS Bootstrap.

### Requisitos de ambiente e dependências

# Requisitos de ambiente e dependências
# Node v17.4.0 (npm v8.3.1)
# React-router-dom
# Axios
# React-icons

### Configurando o ambiente

O primeiro passo é clonar o projeto

1. Acesse o link do projeto e faça o clone do repositório. https://github.com/Danielleelara/cadastro-de-clientes

2. Na pasta raiz do projeto, rodar o comando abaixo para instalar as dependências.

# npm install

3. Rode a REST API com este comando 
# node server.js

4. Agora é só rodar o comando abaixo para rodar o projeto no Browser.
# npm start

Obs: A Rest API rodará na porta 3000 http://localhost:3000 e o front na porta 3001 http://localhost:3001





### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
